Files:
- run.py = Coordinates GUI initialisation and DOT scan list
- dotMain.py = Creating the Asynchronous processes for scanning and streaming
- dotScan.py = Scans for Xsens DOT devices. Parses list to GUI
- dotRun.py = Connecting to Xsens DOT. Parsing to Unity
- dotCSV.py = Creates and formats the data for the CSV file. Performs the quaternion transformation
- dotClassify = Creates the classification model(s). Testing the classifier
- classification = Produces the confusion matrices and visualisation
- \Training data = Location for training data
- \Testing data = Location for testing data
